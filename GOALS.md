## todo

### short term
* want to allow user input to model for given tweets
* want to then use pandas to take the data the model displays and visualize it for user
* read data from cvs --> run tweets through model and then mark new column with pos/neg tag
  * get tweets --> cvs add --> clean tweets(nltk) --> mark tweets --> calculations
* need to write flask scripts for project at the end
### long term
* vectorize everything
* use dask for distributed computing 
* need to speed model up going with the previous consideration could also check sklearn n_jobs out
* either way needs to be quicker
